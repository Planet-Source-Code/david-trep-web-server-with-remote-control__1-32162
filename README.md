## Web Server with Remote Control


</div>

### Description

This Web Server was original on PCS. I have been unable to reach any of the claimed authors. I have modified to code to allow for remote control of a PC via a web-browser. Features include screenshot, logoff, reboot, opencd, msgbox, open browser to web page, screen effects, etc. If anyone makes changes to this code. Please send me the changes so I can keep this updated for everyone. Thanks. David@saveapatriot.org

I hard coded the directory to save the screenshot. Therefore, the program needs to be installed into C:\Program Files\WebServer.
